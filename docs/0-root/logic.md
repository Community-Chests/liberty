# DOCUMENT 0: THE DESIGN LOGIC (THE META-DECLARATION)

This document anchors the fractal intentions of the Mycelium. It is the yardstick by which all other protocols are measured.

1. THE PRIMACY OF RESONANCE
The objective is not "order" (which requires a master), but Resonance (which requires synchronization). Any protocol that introduces a "Master/Servant" dynamic is a failure of design and must be discarded.

2. RIGHT OVER MIGHT
The system operates on Signals, not Force. If the system requires physical violence to function, it is not a Mycelium; it is a State. Power in this system is the ability to contribute to the flow, not the ability to stop the flow for others.

3. THE FRACTAL SCALE
The "Right to Flourish" is identical for a single Spore, a Pod, and the Mycelium. What is true for the individual must be true for the whole. No level of the fractal has the right to "sacrifice" a lower level for its own gain.

4. TRANSPARENCY AS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
In the dark, "Might" grows. In the "Light of Day" (Total Transparency), "Might" is visible and therefore easily bypassed. Transparency is not a chore; it is the fundamental security protocol that makes violence obsolete.

5. BIOLOGICAL RESILIENCE
The system is designed to be Anti-fragile. It expects "Static" (non-participants) and "Interference" (parasites). It does not seek to "convert" them through debate; it seeks to build a network so efficient and nourishing that the old system becomes a functional disadvantage.
