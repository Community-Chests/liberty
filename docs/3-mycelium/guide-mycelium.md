# THE MYCO LINK: A GUIDE TO NETWORK RESILIENCE

### WHAT IS A MYCO LINK?  
* A Myco Link is a deliberate connection between two **Pods** of approximately 150 Spores each. 
* It is not a trade deal or a military alliance; it is a **Symbiotic Bond**. 
* The goal is to ensure that both Pods are thriving and that neither is drifting toward **Necrosis**, which includes exclusion, hoarding, or coercion. 

### WHY NOT JUST ONE BIG GROUP?  
* Scale kills resonance; when groups get too large, we lose the ability to see each other as peers. 
* Large groups tend to revert to "proto-violence" and master-servant dynamics. 
* By keeping Pods small and linking them **laterally**, we maintain the "Light of Day" transparency at every level of the fractal.

### THE "HOW": OPERATIONAL CLARITY

#### 1. What is "Cross-Pollination"?  
* This is our primary sensory tool for maintaining network health.   
* **The Visit**: A "Visitor Spore" acts as a neighbor rather than an inspector or police officer. Their job is to experience the "vibe" and operational reality of the other Pod.   
* **The Check**: The Visitor observes if Spores seem afraid, if food from the Resource Map is being distributed fairly, and if there is any "Dark Data" or secret decision-making.  
* **The Result**: The Visitor returns to their home Pod and broadcasts a **Resonance Report** regarding the health of the link. 

#### 2. How do we handle "Surplus" without money?  
* We use **Trophic Flow**, where resources move to where they are needed to maintain the whole.   
* If Pod A has extra batteries and Pod B’s solar array is failing, the batteries move to Pod B automatically.   
* This is viewed as **Systemic Maintenance** rather than "charity" or "debt". 
* Keeping your neighbor’s systems alive ensures the entire network remains strong. 

#### 3. Handling Inter-Pod Disagreements
* **The Fractal Web**: Because every Pod is linked to multiple other Pods, a single disagreement between two Pods does not break the network. 
* **Peer Review**: If Pod A and Pod B cannot reach resonance, they may call upon a third linked Pod to facilitate a **Restorative Dialogue**.
* **Anti-Gang Protocol**: The transparency of Resource Maps and decision logs prevents Pods from "ganging up" on others, as predatory behavior is immediately visible as a Fault Signal to the wider Mycelium.

### THE IMMUNE RESPONSE (NECROSIS)

* **Detection**: If Pod B starts excluding people based on identity or hoarding resources, the Visitor Spore from Pod A detects the Fault Signal.   
* **Intervention**: Pod A initiates a **Restorative Sequence**, sending mediators to facilitate dialogue and help the Pod resynchronize with the Core Protocol.   
* **Quarantine (The Bypass)**: If a Pod refuses to stop exclusionary or coercive behavior, the network performs a **Bypass**. 
* The necrotic Pod is desynchronized from shared Nutrient flows—including energy, data, and food—until they return to the Protocol. 

### SUMMARY  
* The Myco Link turns "Neighbors" into "Immune Cells". 
* It ensures that **Right over Might** is a functional reality. 
* We watch over each other so that no one has to fear the return of a "Master".
