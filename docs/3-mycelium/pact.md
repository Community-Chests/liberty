# DOCUMENT 3: THE MYCO LINK PACT (INTER-POD SYNC)

POD A: ____________________  
POD B: ____________________  
ESTABLISHED ON: ____________

### I. THE SYNC PROTOCOL
* We agree to a mutual "Open Broadcast" where our Resource Maps are mirrored.   
* Transparency is our shared defense against the return of "Might".

### II. THE CROSS-POLLINATION SCHEDULE
* **Visitor Cycle**: Every [30/60] days.  
* **Next Visit Date (Pod A to B)**: ____________  
* **Next Visit Date (Pod B to A)**: ____________

### III. THE TROPHIC EXCHANGE (SURPLUS & DEFICIT)
* **Surplus Flow**: Pod A and B agree to prioritize their mutual surpluses (Metabolic, Kinetic, Cognitive) for each other before broadcasting to the wider Mycelium.
* **The Nutrient Safety Net (Deficit Response)**: If either Pod broadcasts a "Distress Pulse" (indicating a critical shortage of water, energy, or medical skills), the linked Pod acts as a **First Responder**.
* **Automatic Routing**: Surplus nutrients move to the Pod in deficit as a matter of systemic maintenance, not as a debt or charity.
* **Pod A Primary Surplus**: ____________________
* **Pod B Primary Surplus**: ____________________

### IV. THE IMMUNE OBLIGATION
* If Pod A detects Necrosis (Exclusion, Hoarding, or Coercion) in Pod B, Pod A is obligated by the Core Protocol to intervene.
* We recognize that we are one organism and will not allow a neighbor to rot.
* **Restorative Sequence**: Intervention begins with a Wellness Dialogue and mediation before any desynchronization occurs.

### V. AFFIRMATION OF RESONANCE
"We link our Pods not to dominate, but to sustain. We agree that Right over Might is the only path to flourishing. We are the protectors of each other's Light."
