# THE FULL BOOTSTRAPPER’S MANUAL: POD 0

This guide is for the Nucleus—the first 3 to 5 Spores who decide to build a Pod. You are not just starting a club; you are establishing the first healthy cell of a new organism.

---

### PHASE 1: SPORE DETECTION (FINDING YOUR FIRST 5)  
* Do not try to convince "Muggles" (people invested in the old system); focus on finding those with "Generative" energy.  
* **THE SEARCH**: Look for neighbors who share tools, fix things without being asked, or express a desire for community-led solutions.  
* **THE FILTER**: If they ask "Is this legal?" or "Who is the boss?", they aren't ready. If they ask "How can I help?" or "What do we need?", they are a Spore.  
* **THE GOAL**: Get 3-5 people to read Document 0. If it resonates, proceed.

### PHASE 2: THE INITIAL SYNC (WEEKS 1-4)  
* Once you have your Nucleus, you must establish the "Heartbeat".  
* **THE HANDSHAKE**: Everyone signs Document 1, the signal-sync.  
* **THE CHANNEL**: Set up a low-friction communication method like a group chat, Discord, or a physical meeting spot.  
* **THE 60-DAY CLOCK**: Every Spore must "Pulse" (check in or contribute) at least once every 30-60 days to remain In-Sync.

### PHASE 3: NUTRIENT MAPPING (WEEKS 5-8)  
* Before you look outward, map what you already have to make the "Old System" irrelevant.  
* **THE AUDIT**: List your Metabolic (Food/Water), Kinetic (Tools/Transport), Cognitive (Skills), and Spatial (Land/Housing) assets.  
* **THE DISCLOSURE**: Put this on a shared "Status Board" so the Light is on.  

#### **PHASE 3 OUTCOMES: PROVING VIABILITY**
| Task | Outcome | Visibility | Security |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inventory** | Find redundant assets (e.g., 3 ladders) | Everyone knows what is available | We stop buying from the old system |
| **Skill Share** | Identify resident experts (e.g., Medics) | Triage is localized | We don't rely on centralized services |
| **Tool Map** | High-leverage tools are listed | Kinetic flow begins | Hoarding becomes visible/impossible |



### PHASE 4: THE FIRST MYCO LINK (MONTH 3+)  
* A single Pod is a target; a Mycelium is an organism.   
* **THE OUTREACH**: Find another "Pod 0" such as a friend's group or another street.  
* **THE PACT**: Sign Document 3 to establish your first immune connection.  
* **THE FIRST FLOW**: Trade one surplus, such as sharing a digital library for surplus garden seeds.  
* **CROSS-POLLINATION**: Have one Spore from your Pod visit their meeting to ensure the "Vibe" is In-Sync with the Protocol.

### PHASE 5: THE "RIGHT OVER MIGHT" TEST  
* Friction is expected; it is how you handle it that defines the Pod.  
* **DETECT**: When a Spore tries to "boss" others or hide a resource, do not ignore it. That is a Fault Signal.  
* **TRIGGER**: Refer to Document 1. Say: "This feels like a command, which triggers my Override Detector. Let's resync via a Wellness Dialogue".  
* **RESTORE**: Use mediation; if they refuse to resync, let their Handshake expire. Do not use force. Simply stop the flow of shared Nutrients to the necrotic element.

#### **TROUBLESHOOTING SCRIPT: DEALING WITH THE STATIC**
When a "Muggle" or hostile neighbor interferes, use the **Neutral Signal**:
> *"We’re just neighbors helping each other out to save money and stay safe. It's totally voluntary. If you ever need a [Tool Name from your Map], let us know—we’re happy to help."*

### THE BOOTSTRAPPER’S CHECKLIST  
* [ ] Identify 3-5 Generative Spores.  
* [ ] Perform the Document 1 Handshake.  
* [ ] Map the first 10 shared tools/skills (Document 2).  
* [ ] Establish a weekly Check-in (The Pulse).  
* [ ] Identify one "Neighbor Pod" for your first Myco Link (Document 3).

### THE LONG GAME: THE SPLIT  
* When your Pod reaches 150 Spores, DO NOT get bigger. Scale kills resonance.  
* **Division**: Split into two Pods of 75 Spores.   
* **Autonomy**: When the Pod splits, the Resource Map also splits to ensure local autonomy remains the priority.
* **Resilience**: Maintain a permanent Myco Link between the two Pods.   
* This is how the Mycelium covers the earth—one healthy split at a time.
