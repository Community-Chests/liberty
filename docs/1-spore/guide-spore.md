# HANDSHAKE OVERVIEW: A USER'S GUIDE

### WHAT AM I SIGNING?  
* The Spore’s Handshake is not a contract in the traditional sense.
* In the old system, a contract is a debt you owe to a master or a state.
* In the Mycelium, the Handshake is a **Signal Sync**.
* You are simply stating: "I am running the same operating system as this Pod."
* You are agreeing to be visible, to be autonomous, and to be helpful.

### THE "WORK IN PROGRESS" CAVEAT  
* This protocol is a living document (Version 1.2).
* We are building the plane while flying it.
* By signing, you aren't just joining a system; you are becoming a **co-author**.
* The Mycelium evolves based on the feedback loops of its Spores.
* If a part of the Handshake creates friction or feels exclusionary, we use the **Restoration Signal** to iterate and improve the code.

### THE "HOW": OPERATIONAL CLARITY

#### 1. Why the 60-Day Pulse?  
* We don't want "citizenship" that you forget about; we want an active organism.
* **The 30-Day Window:** You have a month to "renew" by simply being present or active.
* **The 60-Day Trigger:** If you vanish, we don't assume you’re a "criminal."
* We assume you might be hurt, sick, or struggling.
* The **Support Sequence** is our way of saying: "The network noticed your signal is weak—do you need nutrients or space?"
* **Diagnostic, Not Investigative:** This wellness check is a system diagnostic to ensure you are safe and nourished, not an investigation into "guilt" or compliance.

#### 2. Privacy vs. Transparency  
* People often fear transparency means "Big Brother."
* **The Distinction:** Big Brother is a Master watching a Subject in the dark.
* In a Pod, **everyone is in the Light.**
* **What is seen:** Your use of the **Commons** (how much energy you draw, what tools you use) and your participation in decisions.
* **What is NOT seen:** Your private thoughts, your personal relationships, or your inner life.
* We only monitor the **Flows** that affect the health of the whole organism.

#### 3. How does the "Detector" actually stop bigotry?  
* We don't use police; we use **Desynchronization.**
* If a Spore or a group starts acting with "Might" (exclusion or threats), they create **Interference.**
* The Pod’s systems (automated food, energy, mesh-net) are hard-coded to require a **Clean Signal**—compliance with the Core Protocol.
* If you choose to be exclusionary, you are essentially "unplugging" yourself from the Mycelium’s benefits.
* You cannot use the community's vertical farm to feed a system based on "Might."

### BIG CAVEATS & EXPECTATIONS

* **No Passive Participation:** You cannot be "Static" (a silent consumer) forever.
* The system requires enough Spores to be "Active" to maintain the infrastructure.
* **Conflict is Expected:** We don't aim for a world without disagreement.
* We aim for a world without **violence.**
* Disagreement is just "Friction," and friction is solved through the **Restoration Signal** (Mediation).
* **The Exit is Always Open:** If you find a Pod's specific "vibe" or local rules don't resonate with you, you can disconnect.
* You are a Spore—you can drift to another Pod or start your own.

### SUMMARY  
* We are replacing **Compliance through Threat** with **Coordination through Transparency.**
* If you want to live in a world where no one can threaten you with poverty or violence, you must be willing to live in a world where you cannot threaten others.
* **The Handshake is the first step into that world.**
