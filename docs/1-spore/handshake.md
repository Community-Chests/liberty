# DOCUMENT 1: THE SPORE’S HANDSHAKE (SYNC SETTING)

Protocol Version: 1.2 (Signal-Sync Edition)
Sync Window: 60 Days
Renewal Threshold: 30 Days

I. THE PULSE (THE 60-DAY HEARTBEAT)
- Active Sync: The Handshake is a living signal. It remains active for 60 days.
- The Renewal Window: Between day 30 and day 60, the Spore "Pulses" by engaging in a Pod activity, updating their resource map, or simply checking in.
- The Silent Fault: If a Pulse is not detected for 60 days, the system triggers a Support Sequence.
- Intent: To distinguish between a Spore who is flourishing independently and a Spore who is suffering, isolated, or being suppressed.

II. THE SYSTEM SETTINGS (SIGNAL-DETECTOR LOGIC)
Every Spore agrees to broadcast the following signals and detect their interference:

- SIGNAL: RECOGNITION. I broadcast that every neighbor is a peer.
  - Detector Trigger: Dehumanization or exclusion of any Spore.
- SIGNAL: TRANSPARENCY. I broadcast my use of the Commons and my decision-making logic.
  - Detector Trigger: "Dark Data" or secret hoarding of information or resources.
- SIGNAL: CONSENT. I broadcast my autonomy. I do not command, and I do not obey.
  - Detector Trigger: Attempts to "Override" another Spore’s will.
- SIGNAL: RESTORATION. I broadcast a preference for resolution.
  - Detector Trigger: Kinetic interference such as violence or threats.
- SIGNAL: THE COMMONS. I broadcast my alignment with use-rights over private hoarding and accumulation.
  - Detector Trigger: Accumulation or exclusion of community resources for private control.

III. THE SUPPORT PACT
- Response over Retribution: If my Pulse drops or I trigger a Detector, I agree to a Wellness Dialogue with my Pod or its Mycos.
- The Exit Right: I am a Spore, not a prisoner. I can disconnect from the Pod at any time. My Handshake is a voluntary synchronization.

AFFIRMATION:
"I enter this Pod not as a subject, but as a Spore. I agree to the Mycelium Protocol. I acknowledge that my flourishing is tied to the flourishing of the whole. I will offer my transparency in exchange for my safety. I will offer my cooperation in exchange for my freedom."
