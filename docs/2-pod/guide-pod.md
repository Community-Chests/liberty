# THE RESOURCE MAP: A GUIDE TO SYSTEM VITALS

### WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS MAP?
* In the old system, resources are hidden behind "Private Property" and "Paywalls".
* This creates a power imbalance where those with "Might" (money/force) can control those without.
* The **Resource Map** eliminates this by making the "Nutrients" of the community visible to all Spores.
* It ensures that no one can be threatened with deprivation as long as the Pod has surplus.

### IS THIS "SHARED OWNERSHIP"?
* "Ownership" is an old-world concept; in the Mycelium, we use **"Use-Rights"**.
* You do not "own" the cargo bike, but you have a right to use it.
* The Pod does not "own" the solar array; it **stewards** it for the benefit of all Spores.
* The Map tracks who is currently stewarding what, ensuring the "Flow" never stops.

### THE "HOW": OPERATIONAL CLARITY

#### 1. How do we determine "Surplus"?
* A Resource is marked as **Surplus** when the internal needs of the Pod's Spores are fully met.
* For example, if the Vertical Farm produces 50lbs of greens and the Pod only consumes 40lbs, those 10lbs are "Surplus".
* These surpluses are automatically broadcast to your **Myco Links** to prevent hoarding and ensure the wider organism thrives.

#### 2. What about my personal belongings?
* The Resource Map is for **The Commons**.
* Your clothes, your bed, your toothbrush, and your personal items are not part of the "Flow" and do not need to be mapped.
* However, if you have a "High-Leverage" tool (like a welder or a vehicle) that you are willing to offer to the Pod, it enters the **Cognitive** or **Kinetic** ledger.
* Once it's on the Map, it follows the **Core Protocol** regarding Transparency and Consent.

#### 3. How is the "Inventory" maintained?
* Since there are no "Masters," maintenance is a collective responsibility.
* If you use a Kinetic tool and it breaks, you update the Status Signal to **Maintenance**.
* This triggers a "Cognitive" request for a Spore with repair skills.
* If the Map shows too many items in "Maintenance," it triggers a **Fault Signal**, notifying the Pod that the "Kinetic Flow" is stalled.
* **Active Status Management**: To maintain systemic visibility, Spores toggle resources between **Available** (ready for use), **Active** (currently utilized), and **Maintenance** (offline).

### DETECTING MALFUNCTION (NECROSIS)

#### What if someone hides a resource?
* If a Spore has a "Handshake" but is secretly hoarding Metabolic or Kinetic resources, it creates a **Signal Mismatch**.
* The Pod's outputs, such as trash, energy draw, and health levels, won't match the Map's inputs.
* Because every Spore is in "The Light of Day," this discrepancy is eventually detected by the **Myco Link** auditors.
* We don't "punish" the hoarder; we investigate the fear that led to the hoarding through a **Restoration Sequence**.

#### What if we run out of a Resource?
* The Map is a **Safety Sensor**.
* If a vital nutrient (like Water) hits a critical low, the Resource Map automatically broadcasts a **Distress Pulse** to all **Myco Links**.
* This network exists so that one Pod's shortage is met by another Pod's surplus before anyone suffers.

### SUMMARY
* The Resource Map is not about "accounting"; it’s about **Visibility**.
* When we know exactly what we have, "Might" loses its power to exploit us.
* We move from a world of artificial scarcity to a world of **Radical Abundance**.
