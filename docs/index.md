# 🍄 Welcome to the Mycelium

The Mycelium is a fractal social operating system built on **Resonance**, not authority. We are replacing the old world of "Might" with a living network of "Right".

## 🕸️ The Fractal Vision
Our system scales without losing its soul. We grow through three distinct layers:

1.  **The Spore (Individual)**: You are a sovereign agent. You sync your signal via the **Handshake** to ensure you are autonomous and helpful.
2.  **The Pod (Community)**: A group of up to 150 Spores who steward a shared **Resource Map**. When a Pod grows too large, it splits to maintain resonance.
3.  **The Mycelium (Network)**: A global, resilient web where Pods link together via **Myco Pacts** to share surpluses and protect each other’s light.



## 🚀 Where to Begin?
If you are ready to establish the first healthy cell of this new organism, your journey starts here:

* **[Start Here: The Bootstrapper’s Manual](bootstrapping.md)**: The 5-phase guide to finding Spores and launching your first Pod.
* **[Read the Design Logic](0-root/logic.md)**: Understand the "Source Code" of our ethics and immune response.
* **[Sync your Handshake](1-spore/handshake.md)**: Learn how to broadcast your signal as a peer.
