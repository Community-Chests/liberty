# CONTRIBUTING: PROTOCOL FOR PROTOCOL CHANGES

The Mycelium is a living document. We use **Resonance** rather than "Authority" to evolve.

### 1. THE SIGNAL PROPOSAL (PULL REQUEST)
- **Transparency**: Every change must be broadcast openly.
- **Rationale**: Explain how this change aids the flourishing of the Spore, Pod, or Mycelium.
- **Alignment**: Changes must resonate with Document 0 (The Design Logic).

### 2. THE RESONANCE PERIOD
- Proposals undergo review to find "Sync" rather than a majority vote.
- Disagreements trigger a **Restorative Dialogue** to find common ground.

### 3. MERGING INTO THE COMMONS
- Once a Signal resonates with the Core Protocol, it is merged into the Light of Day for all Pods to adopt.

### 4. THE RIGHT TO FORK
- You are a Spore, not a subject.
- If your Pod requires a local variant, you have the right to fork this repository, provided you remain Transparent.
